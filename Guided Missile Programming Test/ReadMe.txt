Here's a quick overview of the feature:

Left clicking will fire a rocket at a target if your reticle is over it! Otherwise, a rocket will not be fired.
Once a rocket is fired it will home towards its target and explode on impact, it will also apply impulse to the object it hits.
Targets are the textured cubes/cuboids you can see scattered around the world.

Holding right click will enable a 'target painting' mode! You can move your reticle over multiple targets and releasing right click will fire a rocket at each selected target.
Selected targets are highlighted in red.
This mode is inspired by an ability in Risk of Rain 2, Engineer's Thermal Harpoons.

The rocket's movement speed, turning speed and time before it locks onto a target can be changed within the RocketProjectile Blueprint!
Rockets have a specific lifetime! If it expires, the rocket explodes wherever it is.
The lifetime of a rockets fired from either mode can be modified within the ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint! The default lifetime is 10 seconds.

I hope you enjoy playing around with this feature! :)
